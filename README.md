### Photonsters High Contrast Net UI (PHCN-UI) 
This is the Photonsters User Interface (UI) modification that addresses a primary deficiency of the default UI as shipped on all original Photons. It replaces the default UI with a high contrast version to enhance legibility of the text and menu. 

Depending on the Photon's installed firmware version, installation of this PHCN-UI may also unlock a hidden network menu that will enable ethernet networking, file transfer and remote printing. 

The Photon UI is completely separate from the printer's firmware and no changes will be made to it. The PHCN-UI is easily installed by just "printing" a single binary file. It is possible to revert to the original default UI at any time, a copy of which is packaged together. 

[The latest PHCN-UI can be downloaded here](https://github.com/Photonsters/photon-ui-mods/). Note that the Photon-S is unable to use this new PHCN-UI.
